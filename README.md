# Distributing-Systems-2023---Project
Project for the Operating Systems Course at Athens University of Economics and Business during spring of 2023.

GOAL
Create an activity tracker app for android like Strava or MapMyRun, using java for backend and Android Studio for frontend.
Take the activities from an XML file and use the MapReduce technique to collect the intermidiate and final results (total distance, average speed, total climb and total time).
For the communication between master and workers use TCP sockets. 
You can read more about it in the assignment paper in greek.[assigment paper.pdf](https://github.com/SteliosIer/Distributing-Systems-2023---Project/files/13322149/assigment.paper.pdf)
